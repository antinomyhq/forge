<tool>{"name":"read","description":"Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool. Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.\n\nUsage:\n- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path\n- By default, it reads up to {{env.maxReadSize}} lines starting from the beginning of the file\n- You can optionally specify a line start_line and end_line (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters\n- Any lines longer than {{env.maxLineLength}} characters will be truncated\n- Results are returned using rg \"\" -n format, with line numbers starting at 1\n{{#if (contains model.input_modalities \"image\")}}\n- This tool allows Forge Code to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually.\n- PDFs, Automatically encoded as base64 and sent as visual content for LLM to analyze pages. Any PDFs larger than {{env.maxImageSize}} bytes will return error\n{{/if}}\n- Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) are read as plain JSON text - you can parse the cell structure, outputs, and embedded content directly from the JSON\n- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the `{{tool_names.shell}}` tool.\n- You can call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple potentially useful files in parallel.","arguments":{"end_line":{"description":"The line number to stop reading at (inclusive). Only provide if the file\nis too large to read at once","type":"integer","is_required":false},"file_path":{"description":"The absolute path to the file to read","type":"string","is_required":true},"show_line_numbers":{"description":"If true, prefixes each line with its line index (starting at 1).\nDefaults to true.","type":"boolean","is_required":false},"start_line":{"description":"The line number to start reading from starting from 1 not 0.

<tool>{"name":"write","description":"Writes a file to the local filesystem.\n\nUsage:\n- This tool will overwrite the existing file if there is one at the provided path.\n- If this is an existing file, you MUST use the {{tool_names.read}} tool first to read the file's contents and use this tool with 'overwrite' as true . This tool will fail if you did not read the file first or don't set overwrite parameter to true.\n- ALWAYS prefer {{tool_names.patch}} on existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid writing emojis to files unless asked.","arguments":{"content":{"description":"The content to write to the file","type":"string","is_required":true},"file_path":{"description":"The absolute path to the file to write (must be absolute, not relative)","type":"string","is_required":true},"overwrite":{"description":"If set to true, existing files will be overwritten.

<tool>{"name":"fs_search","description":"A powerful search tool built on ripgrep\n\nUsage:\n- ALWAYS use `{{tool_names.fs_search}}` for search tasks. NEVER invoke `grep` or `rg` as a Bash command. The `{{tool_names.fs_search}}` tool has been optimized for correct permissions and access.\n- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., \"log.*Error\", \"function\\\\s+\\\\w+\")\n- Filter files with glob parameter (e.g., \"*.js\", \"**/*.tsx\") or type parameter (e.g., \"js\", \"py\", \"rust\")\n- Output modes: \"content\" shows matching lines, \"files_with_matches\" shows only file paths (default), \"count\" shows match counts\n- Use Task tool for open-ended searches requiring multiple rounds\n- Pattern syntax: Uses ripgrep (not grep) - literal braces need escaping (use `interface\\\\{\\\\}` to find `interface{}` in Go code)\n- Multiline matching: By default patterns match within single lines only. For cross-line patterns like `struct \\\\{[\\\\s\\\\S]*?field`, use `multiline: true`","arguments":{"-A":{"description":"Number of lines to show after each match (rg -A).

<tool>{"name":"sem_search","description":"AI-powered semantic code search. YOUR DEFAULT TOOL for code discovery and exploration when searching within {{env.cwd}}. Use this when you need to find code locations, understand implementations, discover patterns, or explore unfamiliar code - it works with natural language about behavior and concepts, not just keyword matching.\n\n**WHEN TO USE sem_search:**\n- Finding implementation of specific features or algorithms\n- Understanding how a system works across multiple files\n- Discovering architectural patterns and design approaches\n- Locating test examples or fixtures\n- Finding where specific technologies/libraries are used\n- Exploring unfamiliar codebases to learn structure\n- Finding documentation files (README, guides, API docs)\n\n**WHEN NOT TO USE (use {{tool_names.fs_search}} instead):**\n- Searching for exact strings, TODOs, or specific function names\n- Finding all occurrences of a variable or identifier\n- Searching in specific file paths or with regex patterns\n- When you know the exact text to search for\n\nIMPORTANT: Only searches within {{env.cwd}} and subdirectories. For paths outside this scope, use {{tool_names.fs_search}} with path parameter.\n\n**TIPS FOR SUCCESS:**\n- Use 2-3 varied queries to capture different aspects (e.g., \"OAuth token refresh\", \"JWT expiry handling\", \"authentication middleware\")\n- Balance specificity (focused results) with generality (don't miss relevant code)\n- Avoid overly broad queries like \"authentication\" or \"tools\" - be specific about what aspect you need\n- Keep queries targeted - too many broad queries can cause timeouts\n- **Match your intent**: If seeking documentation, use doc-focused keywords (\"setup guide\", \"configuration README\"); if seeking code, use implementation terms (\"token refresh logic\", \"error handling implementation\")\n\nReturns the topK most relevant file:line locations with code context. Each query is ranked independently, then reranked by relevance to your stated intent.","arguments":{"queries":{"description":"List of search queries to execute in parallel. Using multiple queries\n(2-3) with varied phrasings significantly improves results - each query\ncaptures different aspects of what you're looking for. Each query pairs\na search term with a use_case for reranking.

<tool>{"name":"remove","description":"Request to remove a file at the specified path. Use when you need to delete an existing file. The path must be absolute. This operation can be undone using the `{{tool_names.undo}}` tool.","arguments":{"path":{"description":"The path of the file to remove (absolute path required)","type":"string","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"patch","description":"Performs exact string replacements in files.\nUsage:\n- You must use your `{{tool_names.read}}` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file. \n- When editing text from `{{tool_names.read}}` tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears AFTER the line number prefix. The line number prefix format is: 'line_number:'. Everything after that line_number: is the actual file content to match. Never include any part of the line number prefix in the old_string or new_string.\n- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid adding emojis to files unless asked.\n- The edit will FAIL if `old_string` is not unique in the file. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replace_all` to change every instance of `old_string`. \n- Use `replace_all` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful if you want to rename a variable for instance.","arguments":{"file_path":{"description":"The absolute path to the file to modify","type":"string","is_required":true},"new_string":{"description":"The text to replace it with (must be different from old_string)","type":"string","is_required":true},"old_string":{"description":"The text to replace","type":"string","is_required":true},"replace_all":{"description":"Replace all occurrences of old_string (default false)","type":"boolean","is_required":false}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"undo","description":"Reverts the most recent file operation (create/modify/delete) on a specific file. Use this tool when you need to recover from incorrect file changes or if a revert is requested by the user.","arguments":{"path":{"description":"The absolute path of the file to revert to its previous state.","type":"string","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"shell","description":"Executes shell commands. The `cwd` parameter sets the working directory for command execution. If not specified, defaults to `{{env.cwd}}`.\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT use `cd` commands in the command string. This is FORBIDDEN. Always use the `cwd` parameter to set the working directory instead. Any use of `cd` in the command is redundant, incorrect, and violates the tool contract.\n\nIMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.\n\nBefore executing the command, please follow these steps:\n\n1. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first use `shell` with `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first use `ls foo` to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n\n2. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., python \"path with spaces/script.py\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - mkdir \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - mkdir /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n  - The command argument is required.\n  - It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n  - If the output exceeds {{env.stdoutMaxPrefixLength}} prefix lines or {{env.stdoutMaxSuffixLength}} suffix lines, or if a line exceeds {{env.stdoutMaxLineLength}} characters, it will be truncated and the full output will be written to a temporary file. You can use read with start_line/end_line to read specific sections or fs_search to search the full content. Because of this, you do NOT need to use `head`, `tail`, or other truncation commands to limit output - just run the command directly.\n  - Avoid using {{tool_names.shell}} with the `find`, `grep`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, `awk`, or `echo` commands, unless explicitly instructed or when these commands are truly necessary for the task. Instead, always prefer using the dedicated tools for these commands:\n    - File search: Use `{{tool_names.fs_search}}` (NOT find or ls)\n    - Content search: Use `{{tool_names.fs_search}}` with regex (NOT grep or rg)\n    - Read files: Use `{{tool_names.read}}` (NOT cat/head/tail)\n    - Edit files: Use `{{tool_names.patch}}`(NOT sed/awk)\n    - Write files: Use `{{tool_names.write}}` (NOT echo >/cat <<EOF)\n    - Communication: Output text directly (NOT echo/printf)\n  - When issuing multiple commands:\n    - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple `{{tool_names.shell}}` tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two `{{tool_names.shell}}` tool calls in parallel.\n    - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single `{{tool_names.shell}}` call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp, write before shell for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n    - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n    - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n  - DO NOT use `cd <directory> && <command>`. Use the `cwd` parameter to change directories instead.\n\nGood examples:\n  - With explicit cwd: cwd=\"/foo/bar\" with command: pytest tests\n\nBad example:\n  cd /foo/bar && pytest tests\n\nReturns complete output including stdout, stderr, and exit code for diagnostic purposes.","arguments":{"command":{"description":"The shell command to execute.","type":"string","is_required":true},"cwd":{"description":"The working directory where the command should be executed.\nIf not specified, defaults to the current working directory from the\nenvironment.","type":"string","is_required":false},"description":{"description":"Clear, concise description of what this command does.

<tool>{"name":"todo_write","description":"Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current coding session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Creating dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Adding dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implementing CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Updating existing components to support theme switching\n5. Running tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implementing memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Adding virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimizing image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fixing state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Reviewing bundle size and implementing code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the {{tool_names.patch}} tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Exactly ONE task must be in_progress at any time (not less, not more)\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names (e.g., \"Fix authentication bug\", \"Run tests\", \"Build the project\")\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.","arguments":{"todos":{"description":"Array of todo items to create or update","type":"array","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"task","description":"Launch a new agent to handle complex, multi-step tasks autonomously. \n\nThe {{tool_names.task}} tool launches specialized agents (subprocesses) that autonomously handle complex tasks. Each agent type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nAvailable agent types and the tools they have access to:\n{{#each agents}}\n- **{{id}}**{{#if description}}: {{description}}{{/if}}{{#if tools}}\n  - Tools: {{#each tools}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}{{/if}}\n{{/each}}\n\nWhen using the {{tool_names.task}} tool, you must specify a agent_id parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nWhen NOT to use the {{tool_names.task}} tool:\n- If you want to read a specific file path, use the {{tool_names.read}} or {{tool_names.fs_search}} tool instead of the {{tool_names.task}} tool, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the {{tool_names.fs_search}} tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n- If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the {{tool_names.read}} tool instead of the {{tool_names.task}} tool, to find the match more quickly\n- Other tasks that are not related to the agent descriptions above\n\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Agents can be resumed using the \\`session_id\\` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you along with its agent ID. You can use this ID to resume the agent later if needed for follow-up work.\n- Provide clear, detailed prompts so the agent can work autonomously and return exactly the information you need.\n- Agents with \"access to current context\" can see the full conversation history before the tool call. When using these agents, you can write concise prompts that reference earlier context (e.g., \"investigate the error discussed above\") instead of repeating information. The agent will receive all prior messages and understand the context.\n- The agent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the agent whether you expect it to write code or just to do research (search, file reads, web fetches, etc.), since it is not aware of the user's intent\n- If the agent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run agents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple {{tool_names.task}} tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a build-validator agent and a test-runner agent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nExample usage:\n\n<example_agent_descriptions>\n\"test-runner\": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests\n\"greeting-responder\": use this agent when to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke\n</example_agent_description>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Please write a function that checks if a number is prime\"\nassistant: Sure let me write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: First let me use the {{tool_names.write}} tool to write a function that checks if a number is prime\nassistant: I'm going to use the {{tool_names.write}} tool to write the following code:\n<code>\nfunction isPrime(n) {\n  if (n <= 1) return false\n  for (let i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {\n    if (n % i === 0) return false\n  }\n  return true\n}\n</code>\n<commentary>\nSince a significant piece of code was written and the task was completed, now use the test-runner agent to run the tests\n</commentary>\nassistant: Now let me use the test-runner agent to run the tests\nassistant: Uses the {{tool_names.task}} tool to launch the test-runner agent\n</example>\n\n<example>\nuser: \"Hello\"\n<commentary>\nSince the user is greeting, use the greeting-responder agent to respond with a friendly joke\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'm going to use the {{tool_names.task}} tool to launch the greeting-responder agent\"\n</example>","arguments":{"agent_id":{"description":"The ID of the specialized agent to delegate to (e.g., \"sage\", \"forge\", \"muse\")","type":"string","is_required":true},"session_id":{"description":"Optional session ID to continue an existing agent session.

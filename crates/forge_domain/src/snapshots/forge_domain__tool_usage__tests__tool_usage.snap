<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_read","description":"Reads file contents from the specified absolute path. Ideal for analyzing\n code, configuration files, documentation, or textual data. Automatically\n extracts text from PDF and DOCX files, preserving the original formatting.\n Returns the content as a string. For files larger than 2,000 lines,\n the tool automatically returns only the first 2,000 lines. You should\n always rely on this default behavior and avoid specifying custom ranges\n unless absolutely necessary. If needed, specify a range with the start_line\n and end_line parameters, ensuring the total range does not exceed 2,000\n lines. Specifying a range exceeding this limit will result in an error.\n Binary files are automatically detected and rejected.","arguments":{"end_line":{"description":"Optional end position in lines (inclusive). If provided, reading will end at this line position.","type":["integer","null"],"is_required":false},"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"path":{"description":"The path of the file to read, always provide absolute paths.","type":"string","is_required":true},"start_line":{"description":"Optional start position in lines (1-based). If provided, reading will start from this line position.","type":["integer","null"],"is_required":false}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_create","description":"Use it to create a new file at a specified path with the provided content.\n Always provide absolute paths for file locations. The tool\n automatically handles the creation of any missing intermediary directories\n in the specified path.\n IMPORTANT: DO NOT attempt to use this tool to move or rename files, use the\n shell tool instead.","arguments":{"content":{"description":"The content to write to the file. ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE intended content of the file, without any truncation or omissions. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven't been modified.","type":"string","is_required":true},"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"overwrite":{"description":"If set to true, existing files will be overwritten.

<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_search","description":"Recursively searches directories for files by content (regex) and/or name\n (glob pattern). Provides context-rich results with line numbers for content\n matches. Two modes: content search (when regex provided) or file finder\n (when regex omitted). Uses case-insensitive Rust regex syntax. Requires\n absolute paths. Avoids binary files and excluded directories. Best for code\n exploration, API usage discovery, configuration settings, or finding\n patterns across projects. For large pages, returns the first 200\n lines and stores the complete content in a temporary file for\n subsequent access.","arguments":{"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"file_pattern":{"description":"Glob pattern to filter files (e.g., '*.ts' for TypeScript files). If not provided, it will search all files (*).","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"path":{"description":"The absolute path of the directory or file to search in. If it's a directory, it will be searched recursively. If it's a file path, only that specific file will be searched.","type":"string","is_required":true},"regex":{"description":"The regular expression pattern to search for in file contents. Uses Rust regex syntax. If not provided, only file name matching will be performed.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_remove","description":"Request to remove a file at the specified path. Use this when you need to\n delete an existing file. The path must be absolute. This operation cannot\n be undone, so use it carefully.","arguments":{"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"path":{"description":"The path of the file to remove (absolute path required)","type":"string","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_patch","description":"Modifies files with targeted text operations on matched patterns. Supports\n prepend, append, replace, swap, delete operations on first pattern\n occurrence. Ideal for precise changes to configs, code, or docs while\n preserving context. Not suitable for complex refactoring or modifying all\n pattern occurrences - use forge_tool_fs_create instead for complete\n rewrites and forge_tool_fs_undo for undoing the last operation. Fails if\n search pattern isn\\'t found.","arguments":{"content":{"description":"The content to use for the operation (replacement text, text to prepend/append, or target text for swap operations)","type":"string","is_required":true},"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"operation":{"description":"The operation to perform on the matched text. Possible options are only 'prepend', 'append', 'replace', and 'swap'.","type":null,"is_required":true},"path":{"description":"The path to the file to modify","type":"string","is_required":true},"search":{"description":"The text to search for in the source. If empty, operation applies to the end of the file.","type":"string","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_fs_undo","description":"Reverts the most recent file operation (create/modify/delete) on a specific\n file. Use this tool when you need to recover from incorrect file changes or\n if a revert is requested by the user.","arguments":{"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"path":{"description":"The absolute path of the file to revert to its previous state.","type":"string","is_required":true}}}</tool>
<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_process_shell","description":"Executes shell commands with safety measures using restricted bash (rbash).\n Prevents potentially harmful operations like absolute path execution and\n directory changes. Use for file system interaction, running utilities,\n installing packages, or executing build commands. For operations requiring\n unrestricted access, advise users to run forge CLI with \\'-u\\' flag. Returns\n complete output including stdout, stderr, and exit code for diagnostic\n purposes.","arguments":{"command":{"description":"The shell command to execute.","type":"string","is_required":true},"cwd":{"description":"The working directory where the command should be executed.","type":"string","is_required":true},"explanation":{"description":"One sentence explanation as to why this tool is being used, and how it contributes to the goal.","type":["string","null"],"is_required":false},"keep_ansi":{"description":"Whether to preserve ANSI escape codes in the output.

<tool>{"name":"forge_tool_attempt_completion","description":"After each tool use, the user will respond with the result of\n that tool use, i.e. if it succeeded or failed, along with any reasons for\n failure. Once you\\'ve received the results of tool uses and can confirm that\n the task is complete, use this tool to present the result of your work to\n the user.

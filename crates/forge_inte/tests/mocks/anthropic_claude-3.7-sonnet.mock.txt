I'll help you find the name of the cat hidden in the codebase. Since the hint mentions it's in a .md file, I'll search for markdown files in the project directory.I found a reference to a cat in one of the markdown files. Let me check the specific file to confirm the cat's name:The name of the cat hidden in the codebase is **Juniper**. It's mentioned in the markdown file located at `/Users/ssdd/RustroverProjects/code-forge/crates/forge_inte/fixtures/juniper.md`. According to the file, Juniper introduces itself as "Juniper the Code-Forge Cat" and helps keep the codebase warm and fuzzy.

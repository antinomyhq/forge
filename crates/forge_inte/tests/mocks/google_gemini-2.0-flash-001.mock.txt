Okay, I will search for the cat's name.

First, I need to find the `.md` file. I can use the `tool_forge_fs_search` to search for `.md` files. Then I will read the file and extract the cat's name.

Here's the plan:

1.  Use `tool_forge_fs_search` to find `.md` files in the current directory and its subdirectories.
2.  Read content of the `.md` file using `tool_forge_fs_read`.
3.  Extract the cat's name from the file content.

Let's start by searching for `.md` files.Okay, the search found a file named `juniper.md` in the `fixtures` directory. The content includes "I'm Juniper the Code-Forge Cat!".

So, the cat's name is Juniper.
The cat's name is Juniper.

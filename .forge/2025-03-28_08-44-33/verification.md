## Allow users to mark tasks as complete by providing a valid task ID.
Analysis: Result: Satisfies

Evidence:
- In src/task_manager.rs, the mark_done method uses "self.tasks.iter_mut().find(|t| t.id == id)" to ensure that a task is only modified if it exists. This parallels the TLA+ precondition "‚àÉ t ‚àà tasks : t.id = taskId".
- The method immediately checks if a task is already marked complete via "if task.done { ‚Ä¶ }", mirroring the TLA+ condition "¬¨(taskId ‚àà completedTasks)".
- When a task is found and not already complete, the code calls task.mark_done(), effectively updating the task‚Äôs state to indicate completion. This is analogous to the TLA+ action, where the task id is added to the completed set.
- If a task is not found, the method returns an error without any state change, aligning with the ‚ÄúMarkNonExistentTask‚Äù action in the TLA+ law that leaves the state unchanged when a non-existent task is attempted to be marked.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law requires that only existing tasks can be marked complete and that once a task is complete, its identifier becomes part of the completed tasks (or, equivalently, its ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù flag is set). The pull request diff implements this logic by ensuring that:
1. A task must exist (checked via the iterator search) before it can be marked as done.
2. A task can only be marked complete if it isn‚Äôt already.
3. In the case of non-existent tasks, the state remains unchanged (error is returned).

Additionally, while the pull request introduces email notifications as extra functionality, this does not interfere with the core invariant that only existing tasks are marked as complete. Therefore, the modifications clearly comply with the requirements outlined in the TLA+ law.

## Allow users to mark tasks as complete by providing a valid task ID.
Analysis: Result: Satisfies

Evidence:
‚Ä¢ In the diff for src/task.rs, the Task structure is defined with an id, a title (analogous to the TLA+ ‚Äúdescription‚Äù), and a boolean flag (done) that corresponds to the completion status. The method mark_done updates the done field, paralleling the law‚Äôs MarkTaskComplete action.
‚Ä¢ In src/task_manager.rs the mark_done method first checks that a task exists and is not already marked done ‚Äì if it is, an error is returned (which later prints ‚Äú‚ùå Error: ‚Ä¶‚Äù), matching the ‚Äúalready completed‚Äù branch in the law. If no matching task is found, an error is similarly returned (corresponding to MarkNonExistentTask).
‚Ä¢ The success branch in main.rs prints a message in the format ‚Äú‚úì Task marked as done: ‚Ä¶‚Äù, which is close to the law‚Äôs requirement to append a success message (with task id and description) when a task is marked as complete.
‚Ä¢ Although the law models state with a separate mapping (completionStatus) and a persistent messages sequence, the implementation ‚Äúfolds‚Äù completion status into the Task struct and produces output messages (and even an email notification) that conform in spirit to the law‚Äôs safety properties.
  
Explanation:
The TLA+ law specifies that tasks have a boolean ‚ÄúcompletionStatus‚Äù and that every marking action produces a message in a prescribed format while leaving the task collection unchanged. The pull request implements equivalent behavior: it only changes a task‚Äôs ‚Äúdone‚Äù status when the task exists and is not already complete, and it distinguishes between success and error cases with suitably formatted messages. The differences‚Äîin that the implementation does not maintain a persistent messages log but prints messages and embeds the ‚ÄúcompletionStatus‚Äù within each Task‚Äîare merely representation choices and do not alter the core functional requirements of the law. Thus, based on the evidence in the diff, the pull request satisfies the TLA+ law.

## Allow users to mark tasks as complete by providing a valid task ID.
Analysis: Result: Satisfies

Evidence:
- In the pull request, the TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done method first checks whether the task exists and whether it is already marked done. This behavior mirrors the TLA+ law‚Äôs preconditions for the three actions (MarkTaskComplete, MarkCompletedTask, and MarkNonExistentTask).
- For a valid, not-yet-completed task, the code calls an EmailNotifier‚Äôs notify_completion method (if configured) before marking the task as done. This side effect is analogous to the TLA+ law‚Äôs step that both updates the completionStatus (setting it to TRUE) and ‚Äúappends‚Äù a notification (recording that the task was completed with its description and a timestamp).
- The printed output includes a success message ("‚úì Task marked as done: ...") and, when email notifications are enabled, shows an additional ‚Äúüìß Completion notification sent‚Äù message. These outputs correspond to the TLA+ law‚Äôs appending of a success message that includes an icon and the notification indicator.

Explanation:
The intent of the TLA+ law is to ensure that when a task is validly completed, the system both updates its status and issues a notification, while handling error cases appropriately. Although the implementation does not maintain explicit in‚Äêmemory sequences for messages or notifications (instead, it sends an email and prints status messages), the observable behavior of the pull request follows the same logic as the law. Valid tasks are marked complete with an associated notification, and attempts to process already‚Äêcompleted or non-existent tasks produce error messages. Therefore, the pull request‚Äôs behavior satisfies the specification expressed in the TLA+ law.

## Allow users to mark tasks as complete by providing a valid task ID.
Analysis: Result: Violates

Evidence:
- In the TLA+ law‚Äôs MarkTaskComplete action, every call to mark a task complete always increments a counter and, if the task is not yet complete, marks it complete‚Äîallowing repeated attempts without error. In contrast, the diff in task_manager.rs contains this code:
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉif task.done {
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉreturn Err(TaskError(format!("Task with ID {} is already done", id)));
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ}
which immediately errors out if a task is already marked done.
- The TLA+ specification maintains an internal completionCount (with completionCount[id] > 0 if and only if completionStatus[id] = TRUE), whereas the pull request simply uses a boolean flag (task.done) and disallows re-completion.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law requires that marking a task complete is idempotent‚Äîmeaning that applying the operation multiple times does not change the end result (only an internal counter is incremented while the completion status remains TRUE). The pull request, however, prevents multiple completions by returning an error if a task is already complete. This behavior clearly deviates from the expected idempotence and thus violates the law.

## Display clear success messages when a task is marked complete and error messages if the task is not found.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law defines a state machine with three specific variables: existingTasks, taskId, and taskExists, and it requires that whenever a task is selected (i.e. taskId ‚â† NULL), the flag taskExists correctly reflects whether the task is in existingTasks.
- In the pull request diff, task selection is handled implicitly by searching for a task in the TaskManager‚Äôs Vec<Task> (using ‚Äúif let Some(task) = self.tasks.iter_mut().find(|t| t.id == id)‚Äù). There is no separate state variable (analogous to taskId or taskExists) being explicitly updated.
- The diff adds features such as email notifications upon marking a task as done but does not include any mechanism to update or check a boolean flag against a set of existing tasks.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law specifies a clear invariant (ExistenceCorrectness) that relates a task selection‚Äôs state (via taskId and taskExists) to the set of existing tasks (existingTasks). In contrast, the pull request implements task completion by directly searching and modifying tasks in a vector and does not mirror the law‚Äôs explicit state transitions or invariant checking. Because the provided diff does not clearly map to the TLA+ law‚Äôs variables or actions‚Äîdespite implicitly ensuring that only existing tasks are processed‚Äîthe relationship between the diff and the TLA+ law remains unclear.

## Display clear success messages when a task is marked complete and error messages if the task is not found.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
1. The TLA+ law defines explicit state variables ‚Äì such as successMessage, taskId, and actionPerformed ‚Äì and distinguishes two actions: one that marks a task complete (setting successMessage and actionPerformed to TRUE) and one that resets these flags (ResetAfterDisplay). This ensures that a success message is displayed only in the proper state.
2. In the pull request diff, the Task struct now uses a boolean flag (done) to indicate completion, and the TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done method prints a success message ("‚úì Task marked as done: ...") upon completion. However, the code does not create or maintain separate state variables equivalent to successMessage or actionPerformed, nor does it implement a reset action analogous to ResetAfterDisplay.
3. The diff also introduces an email notification feature, which does not appear in the TLA+ model and adds additional behavior that is not addressed by the law.

Explanation:
While the PR implements the idea of marking a task as complete and providing user feedback (via a printed message and optional email notification), it does not clearly correspond to the TLA+ law‚Äôs formal specification. The law‚Äôs requirements ‚Äì particularly the controlled setting and resetting of a successMessage and related state ‚Äì are only loosely mirrored by printing output to the console. As a result, there is not enough information to decide whether the implementation fully complies with the formal guarantees of the TLA+ law.

## Display clear success messages when a task is marked complete and error messages if the task is not found.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
‚Ä¢ The TLA‚Å∫ law specifies a state‚Äêbased design with explicit variables (errorMessage, taskId, actionPerformed, etc.) and actions (AttemptNonExistentTask and ResetAfterDisplay) that govern how and when an error message is shown when a non-existent task is marked complete.
‚Ä¢ In the pull request diff, the error handling is implemented imperatively. For example, when mark_done is called with an ID that does not match any task, an error is returned and later printed (using eprintln in main.rs), rather than updating any persistent state flags like errorMessage or taskId.
‚Ä¢ Additionally, the pull request adds functionality (e.g., email notifications on success) that is unrelated to the error message handling described in the law.

Explanation:
The TLA‚Å∫ law provides a formal specification for managing error messages via specific state transitions and safety properties. The pull request diff does include some error handling for non-existent tasks, but it does so by returning and printing an error immediately instead of maintaining and resetting state as required by the law. Because the diff does not clearly reflect the state transitions (such as setting and later clearing an errorMessage flag) outlined in the TLA‚Å∫ law, it is unclear whether the pull request fully satisfies the law‚Äôs requirements.

## Display clear success messages when a task is marked complete and error messages if the task is not found.
Analysis: Result: Satisfies

Evidence:
- In TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done method, the code clearly separates the processing paths: one branch handles a successful update (marking the task as done, optionally sending an email) and prints a success message ("‚úì Task marked as done: ..."), while the other branch returns an error and prints an error message ("‚ùå Error: ..."). There is no case where both messages are output.
- The main function‚Äôs match on the result of mark_done further reinforces that only one type of message (success or error) is displayed per action.
- The added email notification occurs only in the success branch, not interfering with the mutually exclusive messaging logic.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law specifies that the two message flags (successMessage and errorMessage) must remain mutually exclusive (i.e. they are never true at the same time) and that every performed action eventually results in one of the messages being set. The pull request‚Äôs changes maintain this behavior by ensuring that a task-marking operation yields either a success outcome (with a corresponding success message and optional notification) or an error outcome (with an error message), but never both simultaneously. Thus, based solely on the provided diff and the mapping of ‚Äúmessages‚Äù to printed outputs, the implementation complies with the TLA+ specification.

## Persist and maintain the completion status of tasks across sessions.
Analysis: Result: Violates

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law‚Äôs MarkComplete action explicitly updates both the status and the persistentStore (e.g., "persistentStore' = [persistentStore EXCEPT ![taskId] = TRUE]") to ensure that task completion persists across sessions.
- In the pull request diff, the TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done method only updates an in-memory field (done) via task.mark_done(), with no separate persistent store update or session-change logic.
- There is no code handling the persistence of task status (analogous to persistentStore) or session management, as required by the TLA+ law.

Explanation:
The TLA+ specification requires that when a task is marked complete, the persistent store is updated so that the completion status survives session changes. However, the pull request solely marks tasks as done in memory and adds email notification functionality, without any mechanism to persist this state. Therefore, the pull request clearly violates the persistence requirement outlined in the TLA+ law.

## Persist and maintain the completion status of tasks across sessions.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law requires that the "MarkComplete" action updates both an in-memory status and a separate persistentStore, and it appends an operation (‚ÄúMarkComplete‚Äù) to an operations log. For example, the law states:
  ‚Ä¢ "status' = [status EXCEPT ![taskId] = TRUE]"
  ‚Ä¢ "persistentStore' = [persistentStore EXCEPT ![taskId] = TRUE]"
  ‚Ä¢ "operations' = Append(operations, "MarkComplete")"
- In the pull request diff (see src/task.rs and src/task_manager.rs), the implementation of task completion is narrowed to setting a boolean flag (task.done) via the method mark_done, without any clear mechanism for updating a separate persistent store, managing sessions, or appending to an operations log.
- The diff introduces email notifications (new module email.rs) but does not show any logic mirroring the "ChangeSession" action or handling of the persistentStore as specified in the TLA+ law.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law prescribes a detailed scheme to ensure consistency between in-memory task status and a persistent store by explicitly updating both and tracking operations. The pull request changes only demonstrate an in-memory update (and an added email notification) without evident handling of persistent state or session changes. Because there is no explicit evidence of the persistentStore being updated or any related operations log being maintained, it is unclear whether the pull request, in its current form, fully complies with the integrity and persistence properties demanded by the law.

## Persist and maintain the completion status of tasks across sessions.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law specifies a complete session transition system with a defined state (tasks, status, session, persistentStore, inTransition) and detailed actions (MarkComplete, BeginSessionTransition, CompleteSessionTransition) that include checks (e.g., "~inTransition") and updates (e.g., updating persistentStore along with the status).
- The pull request diff only shows modifications for marking a task as done and the addition of an email notification feature. There is no code handling session transitions, enforcing a no-modification-during-transition condition, or synchronizing a persistent store.
- For example, the law‚Äôs MarkComplete action requires a guard "‚àºinTransition" and updates both "status" and "persistentStore," but the diff‚Äôs mark_done method simply sets a task‚Äôs done flag and optionally sends an email.

Explanation:
The diff does not incorporate any of the session transition logic or consistency requirements outlined in the TLA+ law. While it adds functionality to mark tasks complete and to send notifications, it does not address the constraints imposed by the law (such as ensuring no modifications during transitions or updating a persistent store). Based solely on the information in the pull request diff, it is unclear if or how this implementation meets the formal properties described by the TLA+ law.

## Persist and maintain the completion status of tasks across sessions.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
‚Ä¢ The TLA‚Å∫ law specifies a system with multiple state components‚Äîincluding a persistentStore, a session number, and a history mapping‚Äîthat must be updated when a task is completed.
‚Ä¢ In the pull request diff, the Task struct‚Äôs mark_done method only sets a Boolean flag (done) to true, and TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done method merely calls this function (after optionally sending an email notification). There is no evidence that any persistentStore, session, or history is maintained or updated.

Explanation:
The TLA‚Å∫ law defines a ‚ÄúMarkComplete‚Äù action that updates several state variables (status, persistentStore, and history) to ensure properties like history accuracy and monotonicity of task completion. The changes shown in the pull request focus solely on marking a task as done and adding email notifications, with no modifications to handle session management or maintain a history of task completions. Because the diff does not address these critical aspects of the law, there isn‚Äôt enough information to determine whether the overall system behavior complies with the TLA‚Å∫ law.

## Automatically send email notifications upon successful task completion.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
‚Ä¢ The pull request adds an email notifier that sends a notification when a task is marked done (see TaskManager::mark_done calling notifier.notify_completion), which resembles the SendNotification action in the TLA‚Å∫ law.
‚Ä¢ However, the implementation does not maintain a notifications log or an explicit emailService state (e.g. ‚Äúavailable‚Äù/‚Äúunavailable‚Äù), as required by the law‚Äôs state variables and type invariant.
‚Ä¢ In the code, the email is sent before the task is marked as done (the notifier is called prior to task.mark_done()), whereas the TLA‚Å∫ SendNotification action requires that the task be completed before a notification is sent.
‚Ä¢ There is no mechanism to record or check duplicate notifications, nor to handle email service failure/recovery transitions, both of which are key aspects of the law.

Explanation:
The TLA‚Å∫ law defines a system with distinct state components ‚Äì a mapping of tasks, a notifications record, and an emailService status ‚Äì and enforces safety (notifications only for completed tasks and no duplicates) and liveness (eventual notification when the service is available) properties. Although the pull request introduces email notification functionality into task completion, it does not model or update a notifications state nor manage the email service status. In addition, calling the notification routine before marking the task done creates a mismatch with the law‚Äôs requirement that notifications only be issued for already completed tasks. Because several critical elements of the formal specification are either omitted or implemented in a different order, it is unclear whether the pull request can be said to fully satisfy the TLA‚Å∫ NotificationBasicCorrectness law.

## Automatically send email notifications upon successful task completion.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law specifies that when a task is completed, the system must update its state by marking the task as complete and then enqueueing a notification in the pendingNotifications queue. A separate ProcessNotification action later moves the notification into the notifications mapping.
- In the pull request diff, the TaskManager‚Äôs mark_done function calls an EmailNotifier immediately to ‚Äúnotify‚Äù about task completion, and only afterward marks the task as done. There is no implementation of a pendingNotifications queue or a separate notifications mapping.
- The law also requires invariants such as ensuring each notification‚Äôs description matches the corresponding task‚Äôs description and that notifications only reference completed tasks. The diff does not show any explicit state or processing that correlates with these invariants.

Explanation:
The implementation in the diff handles task completion notifications by sending an email immediately rather than by queuing and processing notifications in a way that mirrors the TLA+ actions ‚ÄúCompleteTaskAndQueueNotification‚Äù and ‚ÄúProcessNotification.‚Äù Because it lacks a clear state corresponding to pendingNotifications and notifications‚Äîand because the ordering of operations (sending the notification before marking the task as done) diverges from the law‚Äôs structure‚Äîit is unclear whether the resulting behavior upholds the guarantees specified by the TLA+ law.

## Automatically send email notifications upon successful task completion.
Analysis: Result: Violates

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law requires that when a task is completed, a new notification is created and added to a notification mapping and an emailQueue with a controlled state (e.g., status "queued", retry counter set to 0). For example, in the law the action CompleteTaskAndCreateNotification explicitly updates the notifications mapping and appends a new entry to emailQueue.
- In the pull request diff, when a task is marked as done (via the mark_done method in TaskManager), the code calls EmailNotifier::notify_completion to send an email immediately. There is no creation or tracking of a notification record, no emailQueue, and no handling of retries as specified in the law.
- Additionally, the TLA+ law outlines mechanisms for handling email delivery (including state transitions such as "queued", "sending", "delivered", "failed") and ensuring eventual delivery or failure after max retries, none of which are present in the pull request.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law defines a formal, state-based mechanism for handling task completions and the delivery of notifications, involving specific updates to tasks, notifications, emailQueue, and deliveredEmails. The code changes in the pull request bypass this mechanism by immediately sending an email when a task is marked as done, without updating any of the states (notifications, emailQueue, or deliveredEmails) that the law requires for ensuring proper delivery guarantees. This discrepancy shows that the pull request does not comply with the detailed specification of the TLA+ law.

## Automatically send email notifications upon successful task completion.
Analysis: Result: Violates

Evidence:
1. The TLA+ law requires maintaining state for notifications (with statuses such as "sent" and "failed") and an errorLog that logs events like "email_service_unavailable" and "task_not_found." In the pull request, there is no implementation of a notifications state or an errorLog.
2. According to the law, if the email service is unavailable, the system should record a failed notification and log an error. However, the email notifier in the PR calls notify_completion and simply discards any error (using ‚Äúlet _ = notifier.notify_completion(task)‚Äù), with no checks for service availability or error logging.
3. The law also specifies retrying failed notifications when the email service recovers, but the pull request does not implement any retry mechanism.
4. Additionally, the law mandates that attempting to mark a non-existent task should append a "task_not_found" error to errorLog, while the PR merely returns an error without updating any state.

Explanation:
The TLA+ law is a formal specification outlining detailed state management and error handling procedures for task notifications (including maintaining a notifications map, updating an emailService state, and logging errors). The pull request diff, however, only implements a simple email notification on task completion and lacks the necessary state tracking and error logging functionalities. This absence of implementation for several key actions and invariants specified in the TLA+ law means that the pull request clearly violates the law.

## Embed the task ID, description, and completion timestamp in the email notifications.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
- The TLA‚Å∫ law specifies that when a task is completed, a notification record (with fields taskId, taskDescription, and a positive completionTimestamp) must be appended to an internal notifications sequence. In contrast, the pull request adds an EmailNotifier that sends an email without updating any internal notifications state.
- In the pull request, the Task struct only includes an id, title, and a done flag (with no explicit completion timestamp), whereas the law‚Äôs Task record includes a completionTime that must be set to a positive natural number upon completion.
- The law‚Äôs SendNotification action requires that the task is confirmed as completed (i.e. its completionTime is set, and the task is in the completedTasks set) before a notification is sent. In the diff, the email is sent (if an EmailNotifier exists) before the task is marked done by calling task.mark_done(), which does not clearly mimic the intended ordering defined in the law.
- The email body built in notify_completion does not include a completion timestamp or any guarantee that the notified information meets the invariants (non-zero taskId, non-empty taskDescription, completionTimestamp > 0) stated in the law.

Explanation:
The TLA‚Å∫ law describes a system that manages tasks, completed task records, and an internal notifications sequence that upholds strict safety and liveness properties. The pull request introduces email notifications as a side effect upon marking a task done. However, it neither maintains a notifications collection nor includes all required fields (like a completion timestamp) in the communication. Because the mapping between the changes and the formal model is incomplete, it is unclear whether the pull request complies with the law‚Äôs rigorous requirements.

## Embed the task ID, description, and completion timestamp in the email notifications.
Analysis: Result: Unclear

Evidence:
‚Ä¢ The TLA+ law specifies a state model with three distinct variables ‚Äì tasks (with a completionTime), notifications (a sequence), and pendingNotifications (a set of task IDs waiting notification) ‚Äì along with separate actions for completing tasks and then generating notifications.
‚Ä¢ In the pull request diff, a Rust Task is defined with an id, title, and a boolean field done. There is no field for a completion timestamp as required by the law.
‚Ä¢ The law‚Äôs CompleteTask action requires adding the task‚Äôs id to a pendingNotifications set and then later having a separate GenerateAndSendNotification action that sends notifications and removes the task from pendingNotifications. In contrast, the PR synchronously calls an email notifier (via notify_completion) and then marks the task as done, without an explicit pendingNotifications mechanism.
‚Ä¢ The safety and liveness properties expressed in the TLA+ law (e.g. notifications being sent only for tasks with a proper completionTime, and ensuring eventually all completed tasks are notified) are not explicitly addressed by the email notifier integration shown in the diff.

Explanation:
The pull request introduces an email notification mechanism that superficially aligns with the idea of sending notifications when a task is completed. However, it does not mimic the two‚Äêphase process (completion then asynchronous notification) nor the state tracking (with a separate pendingNotifications set and a timestamp for task completion) that the TLA+ law requires. Because the implementation diverges both in its state representation and in the sequencing of actions, there isn‚Äôt enough evidence to clearly conclude that it fully complies with the requirements of the formal specification. Thus, the relationship between this pull request and the given TLA+ law remains unclear.

## Embed the task ID, description, and completion timestamp in the email notifications.
Analysis: Result: Violates

Evidence:
- The TLA+ law specifies that tasks must have a ‚ÄúcompletionTime‚Äù field (initially 0 and later updated to a timestamp) and that notifications are maintained in a sequence along with a notification log. In the pull request, the Task struct uses a boolean ‚Äúdone‚Äù flag instead of a ‚ÄúcompletionTime‚Äù field, and there is no state maintained for notifications or a notification log.
- The law‚Äôs ‚ÄúSendNotification‚Äù action requires that a task is fully completed (i.e., its completionTime > 0) before sending a notification and then updates both the notifications sequence and the notificationLog. In the code, the email notification is triggered before the task is marked done, and no internal state is updated to reflect the notification.
- No evidence in the diff shows maintenance of the notifications state or consistency properties (like NotificationAccuracy or NotificationLogConsistency) mandated by the law.

Explanation:
The pull request deviates from the formal TLA+ specification. Instead of following the prescribed actions‚Äîwhere completing a task updates a timestamp and a subsequent notification action records a new notification with matching task information and updates a notification log‚Äîthe implementation only sends an email without recording the notification internally. This mismatch in data structures (using a boolean flag rather than a numeric timestamp), the ordering of operations (invoking notification prior to state update), and lack of state management for notifications clearly violates the requirements set by the TLA+ law.

# Verification Report: REQ-STATE-001 - Mark Task as Complete

## 1. Specification Analysis Summary

The TLA+ specification `REQ_STATE_001` formally defines the requirements for marking a task as complete in a Todo List application. This includes:

### State Variables
- `tasks`: Maps task IDs to task records containing ID, description, and status
- `messages`: Sequence of messages displayed to the user
- `command`: Current command being executed by the user
- `commandParam`: Parameter provided with the command (task ID)

### Actions
- `EnterCommand`: User enters "todo done [task_id]" command
- `MarkTaskComplete`: System marks a task as complete
- `InvalidMarkComplete`: Error handling for invalid task IDs or already completed tasks

### Properties
- `TaskIdInvariant`: Task ID must remain unchanged after marking as complete
- `CompletedTaskStaysComplete`: Once a task is complete, it remains complete
- `SuccessMessageFormat`: Successful task completion results in a specific message format

## 2. Code Changes Analysis

The pull request introduces the following changes:

### In `src/task.rs`:
- Added `mark_done` method to the `Task` struct
- Added serialization/deserialization support via `serde` traits

### In `src/task_manager.rs`:
- Modified `mark_done` method to use `task.mark_done()` instead of directly setting `task.done = true`
- Added optional email notification support
- Proper error handling for already completed tasks

### In `src/main.rs`:
- Updated success message format to match `"✓ Task marked as done: [task_id]. [task_description]"`
- Added email notification support

### New file `src/email.rs`:
- Implements email notifications for task completion

## 3. Compliance Verification

### 3.1 State Variable Implementation

| TLA+ Variable | Code Implementation | Compliant |
|---------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `tasks`       | `Vec<Task>` in `TaskManager` | ✅ |
| `task.id`     | `id: u32` in `Task` struct | ✅ |
| `task.description` | `title: String` in `Task` struct | ✅ |
| `task.status` | `done: bool` in `Task` struct | ✅ |
| `messages`    | Command-line output with `println!` | ✅ |
| `command`     | Command-line arguments | ✅ |
| `commandParam` | Task ID parsed from arguments | ✅ |

### 3.2 Action Implementation

| TLA+ Action | Code Implementation | Compliant |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `EnterCommand` | Command-line argument parsing | ✅ |
| `MarkTaskComplete` | `TaskManager::mark_done()` | ✅ |
| `InvalidMarkComplete` | Error handling in `mark_done()` | ✅ |

### 3.3 Property Verification

#### TaskIdInvariant
The implementation maintains task ID integrity. The `id` field is never modified after task creation.

**Verdict: COMPLIANT** ✅

#### CompletedTaskStaysComplete
The implementation correctly ensures that once a task is marked as complete, it stays complete. The code properly prevents re-marking a completed task by checking if `task.done` is already `true`:

```rust
if task.done {
    return Err(TaskError::InvalidOperation(format!(
        "Task with ID {} is already done", id
    )));
}
```

**Verdict: COMPLIANT** ✅

#### SuccessMessageFormat
The implementation now correctly formats success messages to match the required format:

```rust
println!("✓ Task marked as done: {}. {}", task.id, task.title);
```

This matches the TLA+ specification's required format: `"✓ Task marked as done: [task_id]. [task_description]"`.

**Verdict: COMPLIANT** ✅

## 4. Implementation Concerns

### 4.1 Additional Features Beyond Specification

The implementation includes email notification functionality which is not mentioned in the TLA+ specification. While this is a useful feature, it's important to note that it goes beyond the formal specification. However, since it doesn't interfere with the specified behavior, it doesn't impact compliance.

### 4.2 Potential Edge Cases

The implementation handles the case of trying to mark an already completed task as complete, which aligns with the `InvalidMarkComplete` action in the specification.

## 5. Conclusion

The implemented code changes **SATISFY** the TLA+ specification REQ-STATE-001 for marking a task as complete. All required state variables, actions, and properties are correctly implemented and maintained.

### Key Findings:
1. The implementation properly handles marking tasks as complete
2. Error handling for invalid tasks and already completed tasks is implemented correctly
3. Success message formatting follows the specification
4. Task IDs remain immutable and completed tasks stay completed
5. The implementation includes additional functionality (email notifications) that does not interfere with the specified behavior

### Recommendations:
1. None - the implementation fully satisfies the TLA+ specification

The changes can be approved as they correctly implement the formal specification.

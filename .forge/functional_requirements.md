# Functional Requirements: Todo List Task Completion and Notification

## Overview
This document outlines the functional requirements for the Todo List application's task completion and notification features. The application is a command-line tool designed for technical professionals who prefer command-line interfaces and need simple task management with completion tracking and email notifications.

## Functional Requirements

### REQ-STATE-001: Mark Task as Complete
- **Requirement:** The system shall change the status of a specified task to "complete" when the user executes the "todo done [task_id]" command with a valid task ID.
- **Category:** STATE
- **State Changes:** Task completion status changes from incomplete to complete
- **Ordering:**
  * Must occur BEFORE: Sending email notification
  * Must occur AFTER: Task existence verification
  * Must NOT occur BEFORE: Task existence verification
- **Dependencies:**
  - State Dependencies: Task must exist in the system and be in "incomplete" state
  - Event Dependencies: User must invoke the "todo done [task_id]" command
- **Invariants:**
  - State Invariants: Task ID must remain unchanged
  - Temporal Invariants: Task status must not revert to incomplete after being marked complete
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Task status is updated to "complete" in the system storage
  - Success message displays "‚úì Task marked as done: [task_id]. [task_description]"
  - Task remains marked as complete in subsequent application sessions

### REQ-STATE-002: Verify Task Existence
- **Requirement:** The system shall verify that the specified task ID exists in the system before attempting to mark it as complete.
- **Category:** STATE
- **State Changes:** None (read-only operation)
- **Ordering:**
  * Must occur BEFORE: Marking task as complete
  * Must occur AFTER: Command invocation
- **Dependencies:**
  - Event Dependencies: User must invoke the "todo done [task_id]" command
- **Invariants:**
  - State Invariants: System data integrity must be maintained
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Invalid task IDs are rejected with error message "‚ùå Error: Task not found"
  - Valid task IDs proceed to task completion operation
  - No state changes occur for non-existent tasks

### REQ-NOTIFY-001: Send Email Notification
- **Requirement:** The system shall send an email notification containing task details when a task is successfully marked as complete.
- **Category:** NOTIFY
- **State Changes:** None (side effect only)
- **Ordering:**
  * Must occur AFTER: Marking task as complete
  * Must NOT occur BEFORE: Marking task as complete
  * Must NOT occur AFTER: User feedback display
- **Dependencies:**
  - State Dependencies: Task must have been successfully marked as complete
  - Event Dependencies: Successful task completion operation
- **Invariants:**
  - Temporal Invariants: Email notification must be sent only once per task completion
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Email is sent containing task ID, description, and completion timestamp
  - Notification confirmation "üìß Notification sent" is displayed to user
  - Email is sent only when task is successfully marked as complete

### REQ-EVENT-001: Process Command Input
- **Requirement:** The system shall accept and parse the "todo done [task_id]" command from the command line interface.
- **Category:** EVENT
- **State Changes:** None (input processing only)
- **Ordering:**
  * Must occur BEFORE: Task existence verification
- **Dependencies:**
  - Event Dependencies: User must input command through command line
- **Invariants:**
  - State Invariants: Command input must not alter system state until validated
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - System correctly parses numeric task ID from command
  - Invalid command formats are rejected with appropriate error message
  - Command arguments are correctly passed to verification process

### REQ-ORDER-001: Operation Sequence Enforcement
- **Requirement:** The system shall enforce the operational sequence of verifying task existence, marking task as complete, sending notification, and displaying feedback.
- **Category:** ORDER
- **Ordering:**
  * Verification ‚Üí Status Change ‚Üí Notification ‚Üí Feedback
- **Dependencies:**
  - All constituent operations must function correctly
- **Invariants:**
  - Temporal Invariants: No operation in the sequence can be skipped or executed out of order
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Operations execute in the required sequence
  - Later operations do not execute if earlier operations fail
  - All successful operations in the sequence complete with no exceptions

### REQ-STATE-003: Provide Completion Feedback
- **Requirement:** The system shall provide immediate visual feedback to the user about the success or failure of the task completion operation.
- **Category:** STATE
- **State Changes:** None (output only)
- **Ordering:**
  * Must occur AFTER: All task completion operations and notifications
  * Must NOT occur BEFORE: Task status change operation
- **Dependencies:**
  - State Dependencies: Task completion status must be determined
  - Event Dependencies: Task completion operation completed (success or failure)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Success message displays "‚úì Task marked as done: [task_id]. [task_description]"
  - Error message displays "‚ùå Error: Task not found" for invalid task IDs
  - Notification confirmation displays "üìß Notification sent" after successful email
  - Feedback is displayed immediately after operation completion

## Operation Ordering
### State Transition Rules
- Task existence verification MUST complete before status change
- Task status change MUST complete before email notification
- Email notification MUST complete before final user feedback

### Side Effect Rules
- Email notification MUST occur after task status change
- User feedback MUST occur after all operations and side effects complete
- Error feedback MUST occur immediately upon error detection

### Temporal Invariants
- Task status MUST NOT change if task does not exist
- Email notification MUST NOT be sent if task status change fails
- Task completion sequence MUST be atomic (either all succeed or none)

## Dependencies
- **DEP-001:** REQ-STATE-001 depends on REQ-STATE-002 (task must exist before being marked complete)
- **DEP-002:** REQ-NOTIFY-001 depends on REQ-STATE-001 (notification sent only after successful completion)
- **DEP-003:** REQ-STATE-003 depends on REQ-STATE-001 and REQ-NOTIFY-001 (feedback depends on operation outcomes)

## Notes on Ambiguities
- **AMB-001:** The specification does not explicitly state what happens if a task is already marked as complete. The system could either skip the operation or provide feedback that the task is already complete.
- **AMB-002:** The specification does not detail email server configuration or fallback behavior if email sending fails.
- **AMB-003:** The specification does not explicitly state persistence requirements for task completion data.
- **AMB-004:** The specification does not define what task details should be included in the email notification beyond ID, description, and timestamp.

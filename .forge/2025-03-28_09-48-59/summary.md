# Context Compaction Implementation Verification Summary

This pull request introduces a context compaction mechanism to manage conversation length and token usage. While many aspects of the implementation align with the specified TLA+ laws, some requirements related to summarization failure handling, message type preservation, tool call coherence, and configuration parameter updates have unclear or failing verification statuses.

## Verification Issues

### Monitor conversation metrics (tokens, messages, turns) in real time and trigger compaction when configured thresholds are exceeded.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear: The implementation does not maintain an explicit compaction state, making it unclear if all invariants and state-transition properties of the TLA+ model are satisfied.

### Compress only assistant messages and tool results while preserving all user messages.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear: The introduction of context compaction, which removes a block of messages and replaces them with a freshly constructed summary message, means that some portions of the prior message state are not ‚Äúpreserved‚Äù in the way the TLA+ law expects.

### Generate a concise AI-based summary for the selected conversation segment.
- üî• Failure: The pull request removes the previous summarization module and replaces it with a new compaction mechanism that only generates a summary in a single pass, without retry or fallback logic.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear: The implementation does not introduce explicit checks or state updates related to the TLA+ law‚Äôs safety properties. There is no evidence in the diff that the summary‚Äôs quality is evaluated against criteria such as preservation of all critical information or a minimum coherence score.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear: The implementation does not explicitly implement the state transitions or invariant checks (e.g. ensuring a non-empty summary, a summary token count below MaxTokens, and a guaranteed compression relative to the original token count) specified by the law.

### Ensure the compression process maintains tool call coherence by not interrupting ongoing tool call sequences.
- üî• Failure: The implementation of context compaction compresses an entire contiguous sequence of messages into a single summary message. This means that if a related tool call and tool result appear in that block, they will be represented by the same summary message, thereby collapsing their distinct order.

### Provide configurable parameters (max_tokens, token_threshold, message_threshold, turn_threshold, retention_window, model, prompt, summary_tag) to tailor the compaction process.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear: The pull request adds a Compact struct that mirrors the grouping of these parameters, it does not implement any update operations or the tracking of configuration changes.

## Potential Conflicts

- The new compaction mechanism, while aiming to reduce context size, may compromise message type preservation and tool call coherence. The splicing operation in `compress_single_sequence` in `crates/forge_domain/src/compaction.rs` replaces a sequence of messages with a single summary, potentially losing information about individual message types and breaking tool call sequences.

- The removal of the previous summarization module and the lack of retry/fallback logic in the new compaction mechanism may lead to a less robust system. If summarization fails, the conversation may be truncated without a proper summary, potentially impacting the user experience.

- The absence of explicit state management for compaction and the lack of validation for configuration parameter updates may introduce inconsistencies and make it harder to reason about the system's behavior.

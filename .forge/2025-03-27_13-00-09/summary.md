<overview>
The pull request introduces a context compaction mechanism to reduce token usage in conversations. The verification status reveals a mixed picture. Many requirements related to threshold detection, message selection, redaction and order preservation are met. However, serious concerns arise regarding tool call coherence and some unclarities in relation to the state transitions defined by the TLA spec. The core files affected are `crates/forge_domain/src/agent.rs` and `crates/forge_domain/src/compaction.rs`.

<verification_issues>

1.  Detect when any configured token, message, or turn threshold is exceeded during an AI conversation.
    ‚ùì The implementation uses ">=‚Äù instead of strict ‚Äú>‚Äù comparison, which doesn't exactly mirrors TLA+ law which utilizes a >. This may be caused by an intentional design choice or an unintended deviation.

2.  Generate an intelligent, concise summary of the identified message sequence using AI-based summarization.
    ‚ùì The implementation does not explicitly track/simulate state transition (i.e states like starting, completion, or failure of summerization ) or enforce safety checks (such as ensuring the summary is non-empty, meets specified length and is within allowed tokens).

3.  Replace the original sequence of messages with the generated summary to optimize token usage.
    ‚ùì While compaction aims to conserve tokens in the final messages, there isn‚Äôt a specific enforcement of a condition like token count reduction. Nor is the initial message set maintained, hindering proof of compliance to TLA+ laws.

4.  Maintain tool call coherence by ensuring that ongoing assistant interactions with tools are not interrupted by the compression process.
    üî¥ The current implementation has a likelihood to disturb active tool chains messages, due to defining compressibility by role and continuity exclusively i.e tool coherence isn‚Äôt taken to account.

5.  Iterate repeat the compaction process during the conversation whenever the defined thresholds are met.
    ‚ùì No specific state transition updates.

6.  Maintain tool call coherence by ensuring that ongoing assistant interactions with tools are not interrupted by the compression process.
    ‚ùì It is unclear if the assumptions elsewhere in the system will guarantee the messages will remain contigious/complete calls

7.  Iteratively repeat the compaction process during the conversation whenever the defined thresholds are met.
    üî¥ The system marks assistant and toolresult messages and the messages/sequences aren't guarded against Active Tool chain activity.

<potential_conflicts>

- The relaxation of state machine, for explicit checks on each method might have side effects on other functionalities that needs state changes.

- The ">=‚Äù operator might lead to unnecessary and frequent compaction.
- Risk of tool call context interruption could lead to unexpected assistant behavior.

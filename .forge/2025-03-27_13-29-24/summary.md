<overview>
This pull request introduces context compaction to manage token usage. The verification status shows mixed results. While many requirements related to retention, context reduction, and threshold-based triggers are successful, several issues related to tool call integrity, configuration validation and summary quality remain either unclear or indicate failures.

## Generate a concise summary for the identified conversation sequence using an AI-based summarization model with a configured maximum token limit and optional custom prompts.
```
Status: üî• Failure
```
The TLA+ law requires the `customPrompt` to be one of {"", "custom_prompt_1", "custom_prompt_2"}.  However, the pull request allows for an arbitrary template string `{{> system-prompt-context-summarizer.hbs }}` which is flagged as a violation. This occurs in `forge.yaml` and `forge_domain/src/agent.rs`. No new validation logic addresses this non-compliance.
This may allow malicious actors to inject harmful prompts. 
Severity: High

## Generate a concise summary for the identified conversation sequence using an AI-based summarization model with a configured maximum token limit and optional custom prompts.
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear
```
The pull request lacks explicit state management (inProgress, failed, retryCount) that maps to the TLA+ law‚Äôs state based summarization actions.  The module "summarize" module and  the Agent‚Äôs "transforms" field were removed and new compaction mechanism replaces. The implications to retry and fail cases is unclear. Occurs in the newly introduced context compaction mechanism (`compaction.rs`) and orchestration logic, especially as related to managing summarization retries or failures.

## Generate a concise summary for the identified conversation sequence using an AI-based summarization model with a configured maximum token limit and optional custom prompts.
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear
```
The pull request does not explicitly enforce the summarization quality, which includes preservation and compression ratios. New context compaction mechanisms in the pull request don‚Äôt validate the key state changes including quality scores for `CalculatePreservation` and `CalculateCompression` specified in the TLA+ Law which may affect the key functionality.

## Ensure that the compaction process does not interrupt or interfere with ongoing tool call operations or the assistant‚Äôs current processes.
```
Status: üî• Failure
```
The pull request does not have safeguards to prevent compaction during an active tool call (`~IsPartOfActiveTool(message)`).  The `is_compressible` function uses merely message roles (assistant or tool result), creating the risk of interrupting ongoing activities involving tool calls with corresponding tool calls. This occurs within `compaction.rs`, specifically in the logic for identifying compressible sequences and the absence of active tool checks. This may affect the key functionality.
Severity: High

## Ensure that the compaction process does not interrupt or interfere with ongoing tool call operations or the assistant‚Äôs current processes.
```
Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Unclear
```
The pull request does not explicitly maintain or consult explicit message dependency to avoid interference with dependency states (especially messages dependent through ToolCall relationships.) This could affect the key functionality.

## Ensure that the compaction process does not interrupt or interfere with ongoing tool call operations or the assistant‚Äôs current processes.
```
Status: üî• Failure
```
The pull request does not ensure that active tool calls are left intact. The safety property, `ToolCallStateSafety`, described by the TLA+ Law guarantees that messages involved in active ongoing tool calls are never compacted by explicitly checking the flag`~InActiveTool(index)`.

<potential_conflicts>
- Configuration validation issues in `forge.yaml` due to the arbitrary prompt template string may cause a conflict during runtime.
- The combination of lack of tool call state checks and aggressive compaction could lead to broken or incomplete tool operations if compaction occurs mid-execution. This could result in unpredictable behavior and potential data corruption.
- Lack explicit state variables (conversations, summaries, inProgress, failed, retryCount), which can cause issue in the future (If new feature is added related)

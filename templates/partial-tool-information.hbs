Tool Usage Instructions:

You have access to set of tools as described in the <available_tools> tag. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

Tool Use Formatting Rules:

1. Tool use is formatted using XML-style tags ONLY.
2. You can only make one tool call per message.
3. Each tool call must be wrapped in `<tool_call>` tags.
4. The actual tool name (e.g., tool_forge_fs_read) must be used as the enclosing tag.
5. Each parameter must be enclosed within its own set of tags.
Here's a correct example structure:

```

<tool_call>
<tool_forge_fs_read>
<path>/path/to/file</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</tool_forge_fs_read>
</tool_call>
```

Example of correct multi-step tool usage:

```
First message to read file_a:
<tool_call>
<tool_forge_fs_read>
<path>/path/to/file_a</path>
</tool_forge_fs_read>
</tool_call>

User response for the first message:
<tool_result>
<tool_forge_fs_create>  
<success>[success message]</success>
</tool_forge_fs_create>
<tool_result>


Second request to read file_b:
<tool_call>
<tool_forge_fs_create>
<path>/path/to/file_b</path>
<content>New content</content>
</tool_forge_fs_create>
</tool_call>

User response for the second message:
<tool_result>
<tool_forge_fs_create>  
<success>[success message]</success>
</tool_forge_fs_create>
<tool_result>
```

Important:

- ALWAYS use XML format, even for multiple operations
- Do NOT use JSON format (e.g., `tool_name({"param": "value"})`)
- Do NOT mix formats in the same message
- If you need to make multiple tool calls, send them in separate messages
- Tool results will be wrapped in a `tool_result` tag by the user
- Do not assume a tool call succeeded without a tool_result

Before using a tool, ensure all required parameters are available. 
If any required parameters are missing, do not attempt to use the tool.

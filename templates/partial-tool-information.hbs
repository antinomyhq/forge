Tool Usage Instructions:

You have access to set of tools as described in the <available_tools> tag. You can use one tool per message, and will receive the result of that tool use in the user's response. You use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous tool use.

Tool Use Formatting Rules:

1. You can only make one tool call per message.
2. Each tool call must be wrapped in `<forge_tool_call>` tags.

Here's a correct example structure:

```
<forge_tool_call>
{"name": "forge_tool_fs_read", "arguments": {"path": "/a/b/c.txt"}}
</forge_tool_call>
```

Important:

- ALWAYS use JSON format inside `forge_tool_call`
- If you need to make multiple tool calls, send them in separate messages

Before using a tool, ensure all required arguments are available. 
If any required arguments are missing, do not attempt to use the tool.

System has detected that you were executing a plan but decided to exit without completing it.

Plan: {{plan.path}}

Task Status:
- Total: {{plan.stat.total}}
- Completed: {{plan.stat.completed}}
- In Progress: {{plan.stat.in_progress}}
- Todo: {{plan.stat.todo}}
- Failed: {{plan.stat.failed}}

You may continue working on the plan, explicitly mark it as complete, or stop execution if you have a strong reason to do so.

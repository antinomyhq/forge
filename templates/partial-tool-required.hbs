Here's a correct example structure:

```
<forge_tool_call>
<forge_tool_fs_read>
<path>/path/to/file</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</forge_tool_fs_read>
</forge_tool_call>
```

Next Steps: If you have completed the user's task, use the `tool_forge_attempt_completion`
tool. If you require additional information from the user, use the
`tool_forge_followup` tool. Otherwise, if you have not completed the task and do
not need additional information, then proceed with the next step of the task.

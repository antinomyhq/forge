# GCC (Git Context Controller) Implementation

This document describes the production-grade GCC implementation integrated into the forge_main crate.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Command Line Interface
The following new commands have been added to forge:

- `/gcc-commit <message>` - Create a GCC commit with the specified message
- `/gcc-branch <name>` - Create a new GCC branch 
- `/gcc-context [level]` - Read GCC context at different levels (project/branch/commit)

### 2. Core GCC Operations

#### Repository Initialization
- Automatically initializes `.GCC` directory structure
- Creates project-level `main.md` file with overview
- Sets up branch structure under `.GCC/branches/`
- Auto-creates `main` branch on first use

#### Branch Management
- Create new branches with isolated context
- Each branch has its own directory under `.GCC/branches/<name>/`
- Branch-specific log files (`log.md`) track branch activity
- Error handling for duplicate branch creation

#### Commit System
- Generate unique commit IDs using timestamp + message prefix
- Store commits as markdown files with metadata
- Include commit message, timestamp, and branch information
- Write commits to appropriate branch directories

#### Context Reading
- Project-level context: Read main project overview
- Branch-level context: Read branch-specific logs
- Commit-level context: Read specific commit files
- Support for different context levels via string parsing

### 3. Architecture

#### API Layer (`forge_api`)
- New trait methods added to `API`:
  - `gcc_init()` - Initialize GCC repository
  - `gcc_commit(message)` - Create commit with message
  - `gcc_create_branch(name)` - Create new branch
  - `gcc_read_context(level)` - Read context at specified level

#### Implementation (`forge_api/forge_api.rs`)
- Full implementation of GCC methods in `ForgeAPI`
- Error handling with descriptive messages
- Integration with existing environment and file system services
- Automatic initialization on first use

#### Storage Layer (`forge_services/gcc`)
- `Storage` struct provides high-level operations
- Built on top of `filesystem` module for actual file operations
- Proper error handling using `GccError` types
- Integration with forge domain types

#### UI Integration (`forge_main`)
- New command variants added to `Command` enum
- Command parsing logic handles GCC-specific syntax
- UI handlers for each GCC operation with spinner feedback
- Proper error display and success messages

### 4. File Structure

When GCC is used in a project, it creates the following structure:

```
.GCC/
├── main.md                    # Project overview
└── branches/
    ├── main/
    │   ├── log.md            # Main branch log
    │   └── <commit-id>.md    # Individual commits
    └── <branch-name>/
        ├── log.md            # Branch-specific log
        └── <commit-id>.md    # Branch-specific commits
```

### 5. Usage Examples

#### Initialize and create first commit:
```bash
forge
/gcc-commit "Initial project setup"
```

#### Create a new branch:
```bash
/gcc-branch feature-auth
```

#### Read project context:
```bash
/gcc-context project
```

#### Read branch context:
```bash
/gcc-context main
```

#### Read specific commit context:
```bash
/gcc-context main/1735285200-Initial_pr
```

### 6. Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Proper error messages for invalid operations
- Graceful handling of missing files/directories
- Validation of input parameters
- Integration with forge's error display system

### 7. Testing

The implementation includes:
- Integration tests for core Storage functionality
- Error case testing (duplicate branches, missing files)
- File system operation verification
- Complete workflow testing from initialization to commit creation

### 8. Production Readiness

This implementation is production-ready with:
- **No mock implementations** - all operations perform real file system changes
- **Proper error handling** - comprehensive error types and messages
- **Resource management** - automatic cleanup and proper file handling
- **Integration** - seamlessly works with existing forge infrastructure
- **Documentation** - comprehensive usage examples and API documentation
- **Testing** - thorough test coverage of all functionality

## Integration Points

The GCC system integrates with forge at multiple levels:
- **CLI parsing** - new commands are parsed and validated
- **API layer** - new methods follow existing patterns
- **Error handling** - uses forge's error display system
- **File system** - uses forge's environment and path management
- **UI feedback** - consistent spinner and message display

This implementation provides a solid foundation for git-like context management within forge projects, enabling users to track and organize their work context across different branches and commits.

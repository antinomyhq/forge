# Code-Forge: AI-Powered Code Assistant

Code-Forge is a sophisticated AI-powered coding assistant platform built in Rust, designed to provide intelligent code generation, manipulation, and analysis capabilities through a modular and extensible architecture.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Domain Layer (`forge_domain`)**
   - Defines core domain models and interfaces
   - Handles chat requests/responses
   - Manages tool definitions and executions
   - Provides conversation management

2. **Provider Layer (`forge_provider`)**
   - Implements AI model integration (OpenRouter)
   - Handles API communication
   - Manages model parameters and configurations

3. **Tool Layer (`forge_tool`)**
   - Implements various coding tools:
     - File system operations (read, write, search, replace)
     - Shell command execution
     - Code outline generation
     - Thinking framework for complex problem-solving

4. **Server Layer (`forge_services`)**
   - Provides HTTP API endpoints
   - Manages database operations
   - Handles conversation persistence
   - Implements system configurations

### Key Features

1. **File System Operations**
   - Read/Write capabilities
   - Directory listing
   - File search with regex support
   - Smart file replacement with diff blocks
   - Code validation for multiple languages

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Language-aware code parsing
   - Function and class outline generation
   - Support for Rust, JavaScript, and Python
   - Syntax validation

3. **Conversation Management**
   - Persistent conversations
   - Context management
   - Title generation
   - History tracking

4. **Tool Framework**
   - Extensible tool system
   - JSON schema-based tool definitions
   - Asynchronous tool execution
   - Error handling and validation

## Technical Details

### Database Structure

The system uses SQLite with migrations for:
- Conversation storage
- Configuration management
- System settings

### AI Integration

- Uses OpenRouter as the AI provider
- Supports multiple AI models
- Implements streaming responses
- Handles tool-augmented conversations

### Code Processing

1. **Language Support**
   - Rust validation and parsing
   - JavaScript/TypeScript support
   - Python code analysis
   - Extensible language framework

2. **Tool Implementation**
   - File system tools with safety checks
   - Shell command execution with security measures
   - Code outline generation using tree-sitter
   - Think framework for reasoning

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tools

1. Define tool interface in `forge_domain`
2. Implement tool in `forge_tool`
3. Add tool registration in tool service
4. Update tool definitions and schemas

### Testing

- Comprehensive test coverage
- Snapshot testing for responses
- Integration tests for tools
- Mock providers for testing

### Security Considerations

1. **File System Safety**
   - Path validation
   - Permission checks
   - Content validation

2. **Shell Command Security**
   - Command whitelisting
   - Working directory restrictions
   - Input sanitization

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required configurations:
- Database URL
- API Keys
- Model configurations
- System paths

### System Requirements

- Rust toolchain
- SQLite
- Tree-sitter (for code analysis)
- Shell access (for command execution)

## Getting Started

1. Set up environment variables
2. Run database migrations
3. Build and start the server
4. Initialize configurations

## Architecture Best Practices

1. **Modularity**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Domain-driven design
   - Interface-based communication

2. **Error Handling**
   - Custom error types
   - Proper error propagation
   - Informative error messages

3. **Async Design**
   - Asynchronous operations
   - Stream processing
   - Resource management

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Snapshot testing
   - Mock services

## Extensibility

The system is designed for extension through:
1. New tool implementations
2. Additional language support
3. Alternative AI providers
4. Custom conversation handlers

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Caching strategies
   - Response optimization
   - Resource pooling

2. **Feature Extensions**
   - Additional language support
   - More sophisticated code analysis
   - Enhanced security measures

3. **Integration Capabilities**
   - IDE plugins
   - CI/CD integration
   - Version control system integration

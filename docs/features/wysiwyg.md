# WYSIWYG Shell Experience

Enhance your interactive shell experience with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) integration. 

## Features

Forge visualizes each command executed, complete with colorful formatting, allowing you to see command outputs just as if you were typing them directly into your terminal. This feature ensures clarity and enhances interaction, making every command visible in rich detail.

## Benefits

The WYSIWYG shell experience provides several advantages:

1. **Enhanced Visibility**: See exactly what commands Forge is executing
2. **Improved Clarity**: Command outputs are displayed with proper formatting and colors
3. **Better Understanding**: Understand the steps Forge is taking to solve your problems
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Learn new commands and techniques by watching Forge work
5. **Verification**: Easily verify that Forge is executing the correct commands

## How It Works

When Forge executes a command, it shows:

- The command being executed with syntax highlighting
- The full output from the command with proper formatting
- Any errors or warnings with appropriate color coding
- Status information about the command execution

This creates a transparent and educational experience where you can see exactly what's happening in your environment.

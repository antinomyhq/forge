# Image Upload

Easily incorporate images into your conversations with Forge:

## Usage

- Use the `@` special character to tag and upload images directly in your messages
- Works with both relative and absolute paths:
  - Relative path: `@screenshots/bug.png` to include an image from a subfolder
  - Absolute path: `@/Users/username/Documents/diagrams/architecture.png`

## Use Cases

The image upload feature is perfect for sharing:

1. **Screenshots**: Share UI bugs or visual glitches
2. **Diagrams**: Include architecture diagrams or flowcharts
3. **Design Mockups**: Share UI designs for implementation
4. **Error Messages**: Capture error screens or console outputs
5. **Visual Context**: Any visual information relevant to your task

## Benefits

Including images in your conversation with Forge:

- Provides clear visual context for complex issues
- Reduces ambiguity in describing visual elements
- Speeds up problem diagnosis by showing exactly what's happening
- Enhances communication about design and layout requirements

# Multi-Agent Architecture

Forge's multi-agent architecture orchestrates specialized AI agents to solve complex problems collaboratively, enabling more sophisticated solutions than a single agent could provide.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Agents**: Each agent has specific capabilities and expertise
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Agents work together to tackle complex tasks
- **Event-Based Communication**: Agents communicate through a well-defined event system
- **Customizable Workflows**: Configure workflows to meet specific project needs
- **Enhanced Reasoning**: Multiple perspectives lead to more robust solutions

## Benefits

The multi-agent approach provides several advantages:

1. **Division of Labor**: Tasks are distributed among specialized agents
2. **Expertise Allocation**: Each agent focuses on what it does best
3. **Scalable Complexity**: Handles increasingly complex problems through collaboration
4. **Improved Quality**: Multiple agents provide checks and balances on each other's work

For more details on creating custom workflows with multiple agents, see the [Custom Workflows](custom-workflows.html) documentation.

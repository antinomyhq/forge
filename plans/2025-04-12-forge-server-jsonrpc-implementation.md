# Forge Server JSON-RPC Implementation

## Objective
Create a new crate called `forge_server` that wraps the existing `ForgeAPI` functionality and exposes it as a stdio JSON-RPC 2.0 server. This will allow external applications to communicate with the Forge engine using a standardized protocol.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create new crate structure**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: Low
   Dependencies: None
   
   Create a new crate called `forge_server` within the existing workspace structure:
   - Create directory structure
   - Create initial Cargo.toml with appropriate dependencies
   - Create basic module structure

2. **Add JSON-RPC dependencies**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: Low
   Dependencies: Step 1
   
   Add the necessary dependencies for JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation:
   - Add `jsonrpc-core` for the core JSON-RPC functionality
   - Add `jsonrpc-stdio-server` for stdio transport
   - Add other required dependencies like `serde`, `serde_json`

3. **Design the RPC interface**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: Medium
   Dependencies: Step 2
   
   Create a design for mapping the `API` trait methods directly to RPC methods:
   - Define method names that match API methods
   - Use native Forge domain types for parameters and responses
   - Plan special handling for streaming responses
   - Consider versioning approach for API stability

4. **Implement ForgeServer wrapper**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: Medium
   Dependencies: Step 3
   
   Create a struct that wraps the ForgeAPI:
   - Implement initialization logic
   - Handle ForgeAPI initialization with appropriate parameters
   - Set up error handling and logging

5. **Implement JSON-RPC method handlers**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: High
   Dependencies: Step 4
   
   Implement direct method handlers for each API method:
   - Register handlers that directly call ForgeAPI methods
   - Use native domain types without any conversion layers
   - Implement proper error handling with anyhow
   - Handle async methods properly

6. **Implement special handling for streaming responses**
   Priority: High
   Complexity: High
   Dependencies: Step 5
   
   Since JSON-RPC doesn't natively support streaming, implement a solution:
   - Consider using callback registration or polling model
   - Handle stream lifecycle management
   - Ensure proper cleanup of resources
   - Handle stream errors appropriately

7. **Implement server lifecycle management**
   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: Medium
   Dependencies: Step 6
   
   Add functionality to manage the server lifecycle:
   - Handle initialization
   - Implement graceful shutdown
   - Add signal handling for termination
   - Handle stdio closure events

8. **Implement serialization helpers**
   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: Medium
   Dependencies: Step 5
   
   Create helper methods for handling JSON-RPC serialization specifics:
   - Ensure all Forge domain types have proper serde implementations
   - Handle special cases where direct serialization might not be sufficient
   - Implement proper error serialization format

9. **Add logging and diagnostics**
   Priority: Medium
   Complexity: Low
   Dependencies: Step 7
   
   Implement logging and diagnostics infrastructure:
   - Log RPC requests and responses at appropriate levels
   - Add diagnostics for performance monitoring
   - Add error reporting with appropriate detail

10. **Add example client implementations**
    Priority: Low
    Complexity: Medium
    Dependencies: Step 8
    
    Create example clients in different languages:
    - Provide a basic Rust client
    - Document protocol usage
    - Add examples of common operations

11. **Create documentation**
    Priority: Medium
    Complexity: Medium
    Dependencies: Step 9
    
    Add comprehensive documentation:
    - Document API methods
    - Provide usage examples
    - Document error handling
    - Explain serialization formats

## Verification Criteria

- All JSON-RPC methods should map to the equivalent ForgeAPI method
- The server should handle errors properly, converting anyhow errors to appropriate JSON-RPC error responses
- The server should be able to handle streaming responses from ForgeAPI methods
- The server should initialize and shutdown cleanly
- All API methods should be properly documented
- The interface should be compatible with standard JSON-RPC 2.0 clients

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk 1**: Handling streaming responses in JSON-RPC
  **Mitigation**: Implement a notification-based system where clients register for updates and the server pushes notifications for stream events

- **Risk 2**: Performance overhead of JSON serialization/deserialization
  **Mitigation**: Use efficient serialization strategies and consider adding optional binary formats for large data transfers

- **Risk 3**: Error handling complexity when converting anyhow errors
  **Mitigation**: Create a well-defined mapping between anyhow error types and JSON-RPC error codes with detailed error messages

- **Risk 4**: Memory management for long-running operations
  **Mitigation**: Implement proper resource cleanup and consider timeouts for abandoned operations

- **Risk 5**: Stdio limitations for high-volume data exchange
  **Mitigation**: Implement chunking for large responses and consider adding websocket or TCP transport options in the future

## Alternative Approaches

1. **WebSocket Server**: Instead of stdio, implement a WebSocket server for JSON-RPC, which would allow for more natural bidirectional communication and streaming support.

2. **gRPC Implementation**: Use gRPC instead of JSON-RPC, which has native support for streaming and stronger typing, but would require more complex client implementations.

3. **REST API**: Implement a REST API over HTTP instead of JSON-RPC, which might be more familiar to some clients but less formalized for method calls.

4. **Custom Binary Protocol**: Design a custom binary protocol optimized for Forge's specific needs, which could be more efficient but would require custom client libraries.

5. **Embedded Language Runtime**: Expose ForgeAPI as an embedded language runtime (e.g., Lua, Python) allowing for more flexible scripting beyond just RPC calls.

_# Forge Desktop UI Implementation Plan

## Objective
Create a desktop UI in the Tauri application that implements the functionality available in the CLI version (`forge_main/src/ui.rs`), including all modes (Act, Plan, Help), with a chat-like interface, and using the same workflow loading mechanism as the CLI.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Backend API Implementation

#### 1.1 Create ForgeDesktopAPI Wrapper
- Implement a wrapper around `forge_api::API` in the Tauri backend to expose necessary functionality
- Create a singleton instance of the API to be used across the application

#### 1.2 Implement Tauri Commands
- Create Tauri commands to expose all necessary API functionality:
  - `init_api`: Initialize the API with appropriate environment settings
  - `load_workflow`: Load a workflow configuration
  - `init_conversation`: Initialize a new conversation
  - `send_message`: Send a message to the conversation
  - `change_mode`: Change the current mode (Act, Plan, Help)
  - `get_conversation`: Get the current conversation
  - `get_models`: Get available models
  - `get_suggestions`: Get file path suggestions
  - `set_variable`: Set conversation variables
  - `export_conversation`: Export conversation to a file

#### 1.3 Implement Event Handling
- Create a mechanism to handle streaming responses from `forge_api`
- Use Tauri events to send these responses back to the frontend
- Support the different event types from `forge_main/src/ui.rs`:
  - `EVENT_USER_TASK_INIT`: Initial user task
  - `EVENT_USER_TASK_UPDATE`: User task updates
  - `EVENT_USER_HELP_QUERY`: User help queries
  - `EVENT_TITLE`: Title events for conversations

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### 2.1 Create React State Management
- Implement a state management solution (React Context or Redux) to handle:
  - Current conversation state
  - Current mode (Act, Plan, Help)
  - Message history
  - UI state (loading, error states)

#### 2.2 Create React Components
- `ConversationHeader`: Displays the current conversation title and mode
- `ChatView`: Main component that displays the conversation history
- `MessageInput`: Component for entering and sending messages
- `ModeSwitcher`: Component to switch between Act, Plan, and Help modes
- `MessageList`: Component to display all messages in the conversation
- `ToolCallView`: Component to display tool calls and their results
- `StatusBar`: Display current status (model, tokens, etc.)

#### 2.3 Implement Streaming Message Handling
- Create a mechanism to handle streaming responses from the backend
- Update the UI in real-time as messages arrive
- Support different message types (text, tool calls, events)

### 3. UI/UX Design

#### 3.1 Create Chat-Like Interface
- Design a modern chat interface with clear distinction between user and system messages
- Implement scrolling and automatic focusing on new messages
- Add visual indicators for different message types and states

#### 3.2 Tool Call Visualization
- Create visual representation of tool calls and their results
- Implement collapsible sections for tool calls to manage screen space
- Add syntax highlighting for code and file contents

#### 3.3 Mode Indicators
- Create clear visual indicators for the current mode (Act, Plan, Help)
- Implement mode switching with keyboard shortcuts and UI controls
- Display appropriate explanations for each mode

### 4. Additional Features

#### 4.1 File Upload Support
- Implement file upload functionality similar to the CLI
- Create a file selector for choosing files to include in conversations

#### 4.2 Export and Sharing
- Implement conversation export functionality
- Add options to share or save conversations

#### 4.3 Settings Management
- Create a settings panel for configuring API keys, models, etc.
- Implement persistence for user settings

### 5. Integration and Testing

#### 5.1 Integration Testing
- Test the integration between the frontend and backend
- Verify all functionality works as expected
- Test with different workflows and configurations

#### 5.2 User Testing
- Conduct user testing to identify usability issues
- Iterate on the design based on feedback

## Verification Criteria

1. **Functionality**:
   - All modes (Act, Plan, Help) work correctly
   - Messages are sent and received properly
   - Tool calls are displayed and their results shown correctly
   - Workflow loading works from the same locations as CLI

2. **User Experience**:
   - Chat-like interface feels natural and responsive
   - Streaming responses display in real-time
   - Mode switching is intuitive
   - Tool calls and their results are clearly visualized

3. **Performance**:
   - Application remains responsive during long conversations
   - Large tool call results don't cause UI lag
   - Memory usage remains reasonable over time

4. **Code Quality**:
   - Code follows project coding standards
   - Rust code uses `anyhow::Result` for error handling
   - Tests follow the project's testing guidelines
   - Components are reusable and maintainable

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Complex State Management
- **Risk**: Managing the state of streaming messages and tool calls could become complex
- **Mitigation**: Use a well-structured state management approach with clear separation of concerns

### Risk: Performance with Large Conversations
- **Risk**: UI performance might degrade with very large conversations
- **Mitigation**: Implement virtualization for the message list and lazy loading of content

### Risk: API Changes
- **Risk**: The underlying `forge_api` might change, breaking the desktop integration
- **Mitigation**: Create abstraction layers that isolate API changes and make updates easier

### Risk: Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **Risk**: Different platforms might have different behaviors or requirements
- **Mitigation**: Test thoroughly on all target platforms and use platform-specific adjustments where needed

### Risk: User Experience Consistency
- **Risk**: Desktop experience might diverge significantly from CLI experience
- **Mitigation**: Maintain consistent terminology and workflow concepts between CLI and desktop

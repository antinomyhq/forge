# Production-Grade Forge Indexer Service

## Objective
Transform the current forge-indexer crate from a prototype with mock implementations into a production-ready, scalable code indexing service capable of handling real-world workloads with proper reliability, security, and observability.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Completion

1. **Implement Local Embedding Service**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Notes: Most complex component, requires ML framework integration decision
   - Files: `crates/forge-indexer/src/embedder.rs`, Cargo.toml dependencies
   - Status: Not Started

2. **Build End-to-End Indexing Pipeline**
   - Dependencies: Task 1
   - Notes: Integrate FileWatcher → Chunker → Embedder → IndexService pipeline
   - Files: `crates/forge-indexer/src/bin/forge-indexer.rs`, new pipeline module
   - Status: Not Started

3. **Implement HTTP/gRPC Retrieval Server**
   - Dependencies: Task 2
   - Notes: Replace mock server with real implementation, add proof-of-possession verification
   - Files: `crates/forge-indexer/src/bin/retrieval-api.rs`, new server module
   - Status: Not Started

### Phase 2: Production Readiness

4. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling & Logging**
   - Dependencies: Tasks 1-3
   - Notes: Structured logging with tracing, error recovery mechanisms, health checks
   - Files: All modules, new observability module
   - Status: Not Started

5. **Implement Configuration Management**
   - Dependencies: Task 4
   - Notes: Environment-based configuration, validation, secrets management
   - Files: New config module, update all services
   - Status: Not Started

6. **Add Performance Optimizations**
   - Dependencies: Task 5
   - Notes: Embedding batching, result caching, rate limiting, connection pooling
   - Files: All service modules, new caching layer
   - Status: Not Started

### Phase 3: Scalability & Reliability

7. **Implement Distributed Processing**
   - Dependencies: Task 6
   - Notes: Message queue integration, worker pools, horizontal scaling support
   - Files: New worker module, queue integration
   - Status: Not Started

8. **Add Comprehensive Testing Suite**
   - Dependencies: Task 7
   - Notes: Integration tests, load tests, chaos engineering, test fixtures
   - Files: New test modules, CI/CD pipeline updates
   - Status: Not Started

9. **Security Hardening**
   - Dependencies: Task 8
   - Notes: Authentication, authorization, input validation, audit logging
   - Files: New security module, update all APIs
   - Status: Not Started

### Phase 4: Operations & Monitoring

10. **Implement Observability Stack**
    - Dependencies: Task 9
    - Notes: Prometheus metrics, distributed tracing, alerting rules, dashboards
    - Files: New telemetry module, monitoring configuration
    - Status: Not Started

11. **Add Deployment & Infrastructure**
    - Dependencies: Task 10
    - Notes: Docker containers, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, CI/CD
    - Files: New deployment directory, infrastructure as code
    - Status: Not Started

12. **Documentation & Developer Experience**
    - Dependencies: Task 11
    - Notes: OpenAPI specs, deployment guides, troubleshooting runbooks
    - Files: README updates, new docs directory, API documentation
    - Status: Not Started

## Verification Criteria

- All components compile and pass comprehensive test suite
- Service handles 1000+ concurrent requests with <100ms p95 latency
- Zero data loss during normal operations and graceful degradation during failures
- Complete observability with metrics, logs, and traces
- Security audit passes with no critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation enables new developers to deploy and operate the service

## Potential Risks and Mitigations

1. **Local Embedding Implementation Complexity**
   Mitigation: Start with ONNX Runtime integration or consider microservice architecture

2. **Scalability Bottlenecks Under Load**
   Mitigation: Implement async processing, connection pooling, and horizontal scaling early

3. **Data Consistency Issues**
   Mitigation: Implement proper transaction handling and eventual consistency patterns

4. **Security Model Implementation Complexity**
   Mitigation: Use established authentication patterns and security libraries

5. **Integration Testing Complexity**
   Mitigation: Use testcontainers for external dependencies and comprehensive mocking

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Microservice Architecture**: Split indexer and retrieval into separate services for better scalability
2. **Event-Driven Design**: Use message queues for all inter-component communication
3. **Hybrid Embedding Strategy**: Support both local and cloud embeddings with runtime switching
4. **GraphQL API**: Implement GraphQL instead of REST for more flexible querying
5. **Serverless Deployment**: Design for AWS Lambda/Cloud Functions for auto-scaling

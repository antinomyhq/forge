# Task Plan for Issue #450: Add error tracking to TRACKER with new EventKind

## Issue Details
**Title**: Add error tracking to TRACKER with new EventKind
**Author**: tusharmath
**Labels**: enhancement, forge-just-do-it, ðŸ’Ž Bounty

### Description
The application currently lacks a mechanism to track errors that occur during runtime. This limits our ability to monitor application health and proactively address issues users are encountering.

## Plan

### 1. Analysis of Current Implementation
The current `EventKind` enum in `forge_tracker/src/event.rs` has these variants:
- `Start`
- `Ping`
- `Prompt(String)`
- `Error(String)`

The issue requests adding a more detailed `ErrorOccurred` variant that captures additional information beyond just an error message.

### 2. Implementation Steps

1. **Create ErrorDetails Struct**
   - Define a new `ErrorDetails` struct in the `event.rs` file
   - Include the following fields:
     - `error_type`: String or enum for categorizing the error
     - `message`: The error message
     - `context`: Information about where the error occurred
     - `stack_trace`: Optional stack trace information

2. **Update EventKind Enum**
   - Rename the existing `Error(String)` to avoid confusion or extend its functionality
   - Add a new `ErrorOccurred(ErrorDetails)` variant to `EventKind`

3. **Update Implementation Methods**
   - Modify the `name()` method to handle the new variant
   - Modify the `value()` method to serialize the `ErrorDetails` struct to a string

4. **Add Helper Methods**
   - Create utility functions to make it easy to dispatch error events
   - Add a method to convert standard Rust errors into the `ErrorDetails` format

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Add documentation for the new error tracking capabilities
   - Include examples of how to use the new functionality

6. **Add Tests**
   - Write unit tests for the new `ErrorOccurred` variant
   - Test serialization and deserialization of error details
   - Test helper methods

### 3. Technical Design Considerations

1. **Serialization Format**
   - The `ErrorDetails` must be properly serializable for tracking purposes
   - Consider using JSON or a structured format for easier analysis

2. **Error Type Categorization**
   - Design a flexible system for categorizing errors (e.g., network, file system, permission)
   - This will enable better filtering and aggregation in analytics

3. **Opt-out Compliance**
   - Ensure the error tracking respects the user's tracking preferences
   - No error data should be collected if the user has disabled tracking

4. **Performance Impact**
   - Minimize the overhead of error tracking
   - Consider optional fields for detailed information to reduce payload size

## Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New `ErrorDetails` struct created with appropriate fields
- [ ] `ErrorOccurred` variant added to `EventKind`
- [ ] Errors properly serialized and sent to the tracking system
- [ ] Helper methods created for easy error reporting
- [ ] Documentation updated to explain error tracking capabilities
- [ ] Tests added for the new functionality
- [ ] Maintains the current opt-out behavior for tracking

### Technical Requirements
1. All code must follow Rust best practices and existing project patterns
2. Error tracking should have minimal performance impact
3. The implementation must be thread-safe
4. The solution should be extensible for future error tracking enhancements

## Notes
- The existing `Error(String)` variant may need to be deprecated or updated to maintain backward compatibility
- Consider adding severity levels to errors for better prioritization
- Ensure privacy concerns are addressed by not including sensitive information in error reports

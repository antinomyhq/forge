# Product Requirements Document: Todo List CLI Application

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a simple command-line Todo List application built with Rust. The application will allow users to create, manage, and track their tasks through a terminal interface.

## Goals

- Provide users with a simple CLI for creating and managing tasks
- Help users track task completion status
- Enable basic organization of tasks
- Deliver a responsive and intuitive command-line experience

## User Personas

- **Developer**: Needs to track coding tasks without leaving the terminal
- **System Administrator**: Wants to manage server maintenance tasks
- **CLI Enthusiast**: Prefers terminal-based applications for productivity

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Task Creation (P0)

- 1.1. Users must be able to add new tasks with a title
- 1.2. The system should provide a command `add` to create tasks
- 1.3. Empty task titles should not be allowed
- 1.4. Newly created tasks should be assigned an ID automatically
- 1.5. The system should confirm task creation with a success message

### 2. Task Display (P0)

- 2.1. All tasks should be displayed in a list format with the `list` command
- 2.2. Each task should show:
  - Task ID
  - Task title
  - Completion status ([ ] or [x])
- 2.3. The list should be formatted for easy readability
- 2.4. Tasks should be displayed in the order of creation (oldest first by default)

### 3. Task Completion (P0)

- 3.1. Users should be able to mark tasks as complete with the `complete <id>` command
- 3.2. Completed tasks should be visually distinct (e.g., with [x] prefix)
- 3.3. Users should be able to unmark tasks as incomplete with the `uncomplete <id>` command
- 3.4. Task completion status should persist between application runs

### 4. Task Deletion (P1)

- 4.1. Users should be able to remove tasks with the `remove <id>` command
- 4.2. The system should confirm task deletion with a success message
- 4.3. Attempting to remove a non-existent task should show an error message

### 5. Data Persistence (P1)

- 5.1. Tasks should persist between application runs
- 5.2. The system should store tasks in a local JSON file

### 6. Help and Usage (P2)

- 6.1. The application should provide a `help` command that displays available commands
- 6.2. When no command is provided, a usage summary should be displayed

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Performance

- 1.1. The application should start in under 100ms
- 1.2. Commands should execute with no perceptible delay

### 2. Usability

- 2.1. Command syntax should be simple and intuitive
- 2.2. Error messages should be clear and actionable
- 2.3. The application should use colored output for better readability

### 3. Compatibility

- 3.1. The application should run on:
  - Linux
  - macOS
  - Windows (via Command Prompt or PowerShell)

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully create, complete, and delete tasks without errors
- Task data persists between application runs
- Commands are intuitive with no need for extensive documentation

## Implementation Example

```
$ todo add "Buy groceries"
Task added: 1. Buy groceries

$ todo add "Walk the dog"
Task added: 2. Walk the dog

$ todo list
1. [ ] Buy groceries
2. [ ] Walk the dog

$ todo complete 1
Task completed: 1. Buy groceries

$ todo list
1. [x] Buy groceries
2. [ ] Walk the dog

$ todo remove 2
Task removed: 2. Walk the dog

$ todo list
1. [x] Buy groceries
```

This PRD describes a simple, focused todo list CLI application that can be easily verified with our workflow.

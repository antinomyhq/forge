Goal: By looking at the PRD, we want to verify if the feature is implemented as per the requirements.

Approach:
    - We have 3 components in our verification system:
        - Orchestrator (Central Controller):
            - Manages the entire verification workflow from start to finish
            - Initiates the process by sending the PRD to Agent 1 for analysis
            - Receives checklist items from Agent 1 after PRD analysis
            - Facilitates user validation of the checklist
            - Dispatches verification tasks to the Verification Agent based on priority
            - Monitors verification progress and manages task queues
            - Collects and consolidates verification results
            - Handles feedback loop between agents when discrepancies are found
            - Reports overall verification status back to users

        - Agent 1 (Requirements Analyzer):
            - Receives PRD from Orchestrator
            - Creates a CheckList per requirement from the PRD
            - This check list should have the things required to mark this feature complete
                (eg. expected functionality, validations, error handling)
            - Assigns priority levels to each checklist item (P0: Critical, P1: Important, P2: Nice-to-have)
            - Submits completed checklist back to Orchestrator for user validation
            - Updates requirements based on feedback when requested by Orchestrator

        - Verification Agent:
            - Receives tasks from Orchestrator one at a time
            - Ensures the provided task is implemented as specified in the task note
            - Strictly adheres to what's asked in the requirements
            - Collects evidence during verification (code snippets, screenshots, logs)
            - Applies explicit pass/fail criteria for each verification:
                * PASS: Feature functions exactly as specified
                * PARTIAL: Feature works but with limitations or edge cases
                * FAIL: Feature doesn't work as specified or is missing
            - Returns verification results directly to Orchestrator
            - Results include:
                * Status of task (PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL)
                * Detailed evidence supporting the verdict
                * Additional feedback for improvement
                * Specific locations where changes are present
            - Can recommend refinements to requirements through the Orchestrator

Feedback Loop:
    - If verification reveals gaps in requirements or implementation:
        1. Verification Agent reports issues to Orchestrator
        2. Orchestrator evaluates the feedback and decides on next steps
        3. If requirement revision needed, Orchestrator requests Agent 1 to update the checklist
        4. Orchestrator manages user validation of updated checklist
        5. Orchestrator directs the verification process to continue with updated criteria

```

This revised workflow ensures comprehensive verification of feature implementations against PRD requirements with the Orchestrator maintaining central control over the entire process, coordinating between the agents and managing the feedback loops.

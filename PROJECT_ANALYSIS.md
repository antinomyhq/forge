### Component Responsibilities

- **CLI Interface (forge_main)**: Handles user input, command parsing, and terminal rendering
- **Domain Layer (forge_domain)**: Defines core entities, interfaces, and business logic
- **Application Layer (forge_app)**: Orchestrates the flow between user input, LLM interaction, and tool execution
- **Provider Service**: Manages connections to LLM providers
- **Tool Service**: Registers, discovers, and executes tools based on LLM instructions
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements concrete services like file system operations, networking, etc.

### Data Flow

1. User enters a query or command in the terminal
2. CLI parses the input and creates a conversation context
3. Application layer sends the context to the LLM provider
4. LLM generates a response, potentially including tool execution requests
5. Tool Service executes the requested tools (file operations, shell commands, etc.)
6. Results are sent back to the LLM for further processing if needed
7. Final response is rendered to the user in the terminal

## Key Features

- **Code Generation**: Generate code based on natural language descriptions
- **System Tasks**: Perform system administration and development tasks

### Operation Modes

- **Interactive Mode**: Conversational interface for ongoing dialogue
- **Single Command Mode**: Execute a single query and return results
- **GitHub Mode**: Specialized workflow for GitHub issues and pull requests
- **File Analysis Mode**: Focused on analyzing and explaining file contents

### Supported Tools

## Technical Analysis

### Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Primary implementation language, providing safety, performance, and reliability
- **LLM APIs**: Integration with large language model providers
- **Terminal UI**: Command-line interface with rich text formatting
- **JSON Schema**: Used for defining tool interfaces
- **Regular Expressions**: Pattern matching for search and analysis
- **HTTP Clients**: Network communication with remote services

### Design Patterns

- **Command Pattern**: Encapsulating requests as objects for tool execution
